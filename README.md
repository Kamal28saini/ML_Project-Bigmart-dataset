We Have a bigmart data set csv file .

In it we have categorical columns we have to convert it into continuous for supervised learning.

We import data and then do data cleaning and then doing the label one hot encoding for the columns which are not numeric

and the use models of regression like regression,lasso,ridge,elasticnet etc.
